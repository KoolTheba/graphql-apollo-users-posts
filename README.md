# Graphql + Apollo Users' posts app
 ⚛️ Mini app made with React, Router, GraphQL and Apollo for reading random users' posts 📚 

 This project has the intention of practicing with GraphQL and Apollo.

 If you'd like to start it from scratch, check the instructions at [this repo](https://github.com/zamarrowski/Curso-React-Redux) in the section `7.React con GraphQL`

## Dependencies
- GraphQL
- Apollo client
- React Router
- Apollo server
- Express

## Up and running 🚀

What can you do from here? 

1. You can check the project around just reading the code
2. You can try yourself to develop it in your own ways and practice React and GraphQL
3. You can do some PR's or open issues with new features, and we can develop them together

I'm sure you already know them, but, here are the steps:

#### 1. Clone the project

`https://github.com/KoolTheba/graphql-apollo-users-posts.git`

#### 2. Install dependencies

You should install the dependencies for the server and the client.

For the **server**:

- Go to the `server` directory

For the **client**:

- Go to the `root`

For both:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Up and running! `npm run start`


## What's next
- Testing
- Improve styling

> 😎 Tasks for you: clone the project and practice your testing skills and styling skills with any library you prefer (Jest, Enzyme, Testing-Library, Style-components 💅 ...)

## Thanks to
@zamarrowski for the course and the server 🦄
